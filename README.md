# Quadratic-Formula-Calc
Quadratic-Formula-Calc is a high school-level calculator designed to solve standard form, factored form, and vertex form quadratic equations. The calculator is programmed to take input in the form of fractions or decimals and generates output with up to two decimal places.

# Features
- Accepts fractions or decimals as input.
- Calculates solutions for standard form, factored form, and vertex form quadratic equations.
- Graphs the quadratic equation, and highlights points on the graph where the equation intersects with whole number coordinates.
- Cross-platform compatibility.

# Usage
To use Quadratic-Formula-Calc, simply run the code in a Python environment, and follow the prompts to input values for the quadratic equation. The calculator will generate the appropriate solutions, and graph the equation.

# Libraries/dependencies
Quadratic-Formula-Calc uses the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Fractions (optional)

# Note about the author
Please note that this code may not be fully optimized or streamlined, as it was developed by an amateur programmer with a passion for coding. As such, there may be more efficient ways to achieve the same results. However, this project is intended to serve as a learning opportunity and a demonstration of basic quadratic equation concepts.
