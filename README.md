# Quadratic-Formula-Calc
Advancedish (highschool level more like it) calculator that calculates standard form, factored form, and vertex form.

# What I tested
So far Tested Fractions in vertex forms
Still need to test Factored and standard form
Graphs work too as it point dots in x,y intergers (example if parabola intersects with 3,4 since both 3 and 4 are whole numbers. If you don't get what I mean I recommend trying this code out)

Tested all the code in pycharm 2023.1 Community edition Build #PC-231.8109.197, built on March 29, 2023


# Libraries/dependencies needed

numpy 
matplotlib
fractions (Optional depending on the DE of your choice)

# What the license means

I don't care what you use my code for as long as I get credit somewhere
